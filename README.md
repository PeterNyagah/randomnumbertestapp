# Random Number Test App

## Task

Create a mobile application that tracks the number of times a number input by the user matches the
random number generated. The application should also record the time in milliseconds between the
matches of the same input number. There should be no way to control the random generator from the
UI. You can keep the tracking data in any data store or data structure of your choice.
